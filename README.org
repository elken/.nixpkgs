Flake-less (for now) [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][home-manager]] based [[https://nixos.org/learn.html][Nix]] config. Also includes my [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]] setup.

* [[file:bootstrap][bootstrap]]
Simple script to install Nix and set everything up for me. In an ideal world, I'd be able to just =curl= this but not /just/ yet.

- Install Nix
- Setup cachix
- Clone my emacs setup (chemacs is pinned in [[file:home.nix][home-manager]])
- Create some directories (config is assumed already, would need to be handled properly to be =curl=-able)
- Install home-manager and create the first generation (/could/ take a while but with cachix setup properly it's normally done in a few minutes)
- Few smaller tweaks
- Install [[https://brew.sh][brew]] if on MacOS
- Sync doom setup (currently can cause issues if the environment isn't properly sourced)

* [[file:pam.nix][pam.nix]]
Overrides to allow the usage of Touch ID for sudo commands.

Toggle with ~security.pam.enableSudoTouchIdAuth = <true/false>~ in [[file:darwin-configuration.nix][darwin-configuration.nix]].

* [[file:home.nix][home.nix]]
The main home-manager setup.  The overall config is lightly documented and quite straightforward. I took the opportunity to greatly simplify my dotfiles, it also where possible handles settings consistently for both MacOS and Linux (though the Linux might need some tweaking).

This will likely expand to a proper NixOS setup at some point, but for now I'm satiated.o

* [[file:darwin-configuration.nix][darwin-configuration.nix]]
My setup for MacOS. I don't have more-than-1-machine needs for MacOS so I'm fine with a one-size-fits-all setup.

Where possible I've tried to prefer using Nix; however it's not quite possible for GUI apps and a few exceptions. Alfred makes it quite difficult to use Nix with so I've had to include a couple of brew packages.
